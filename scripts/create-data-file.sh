# Pre-requisite - Check and set below values once.
# 1. `NODE_URL` and `MNEMONIC` are set in .env file
# 2. github cli `gh` is installed https://cli.github.com/. `jq` is required as well.
# 3. Need github personal access token to create PR (do not work with ssh keys). Set `TOKEN_FILE` with file with some external path contains PAT.
#    DO NOT commit `token.txt` file, if committed, github will automatically revoke the PAT.
# 4. Set `END_BLOCK_DIFF` parameter with desired value. This will be used to calculate endBlock value (Current block No - END_BLOCK_DIFF)
# 5. Set `REPO` Name - Handy if we want to raise PR in fork for testing.


# PARAMETERS
#TOEKN FILE - Keep it at external path and DO NOT COMMIT it in repo.
TOKEN_FILE=~/scripts/token.txt
# 1 hour old block (Current block No - END_BLOCK_DIFF)
# Considering 1 hour generate ~250 blocks on average.
END_BLOCK_DIFF=250
# TODO REVIWER is not working at present, looks issue with `gh` cli
